# RxJS

# What is RxJS?

## Reactive Extension for JavaScript

RxJS is a library for **observing** and **reacting** to data and events by using observable sequences.

# Why Use RxJS?

- Provide a single technique for working with any type of data: Events from keyboard, mouse, routes, data from array, files, databases, APIs. We work with different data sources using the same techniques and operators.
- Compositional: Our views often require data combined from several sources. We easily compose data with RxJS.
- RxJS can produce multiple values over time and uses a push model to notify our code when specific actions occur, making it easy for us to watch and react to user interactions or data changes.
- RxJS is lazy. Evaluation does not start until subscription. So we can create recipes that only execute when we need the result.
- Built-in Error Handler
- Cancellable: If user clicks on product A and then quickly clicks on product B, we can cancel the request for product A and only return product B.

# Observable

An observable represents a stream, or source of data that can arrive over time. You can create an observable from nearly anything, but the most common use case in RxJS is from events.

```jsx
// import the fromEvent operator
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

// grab button reference
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// create an observable of button clicks
const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');
```

# Subscription

Subscriptions are what set everything in motion. You can think of this like a faucet, you have a stream of water ready to be tapped (observable), someone just needs to turn the handle. In the case of observables, that role belongs to the `subscriber` .

To create a subscription, you call the `subscribe` method, supplying a function (or object) - also known as an `observer` . This is where you can decide how to **react** to each event.

 

```jsx
// import the fromEvent operator
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';

// grab button reference
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

// create an observable of button clicks
const myObservable = fromEvent(button, 'click');

// for now, let's just log the event on each click
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe(event => console.log(event));
```

It’s important to note that each subscription will create a new execution context. This means calling `subscribe` a second time will create a new event listener.

# Operators

Operators offer a way to manipulate values from a source, returning an **observable** of the transformed values. 

```jsx
const observable = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

observable.pipe( **map(item => item * 2)** ).subscribe(console.log); // log: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
observable.subscribe(console.log); // log: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

### Pipe

The `pipe` function is the assembly line from your observable data source through your operators. Just like raw material in a factory goes through a series of stops before it becomes a finished product, source data can pass through a pipeline of operators where you can manipulate, filter, and transform the data to fit your use case.

### Operator can be grouped into common categories

The first stop when looking for the correct operator is finding a related category. 

### Creation operators

These operator allow the creation of an observable from nearly anything.

The most commonly used creation operators are:

- `of`
- `from`
- `fromEvent`
- `ajax`

### Combination operators

The combination operators allow the joining of information from multiple observables. 

The most commonly used creation operators are: 

- `combineLatest`
- `concat`
- `merge`
- `startWith`
- `withLatestFrom`

### Error handling operators

The error handling operator provide effective ways to gracefully handle errors and perform retries, should they occur.

The most commonly used creation operators are: 

- `catchError`

### Filtering operators

The filtering operators provide techniques for accepting - or declining - values from an observable source and dealing with backpressure, or the build up of values within a stream.

The most commonly used creation operators are: 

- `debounceTime`
- `distincUntilChanged`
- `filter`
- `take`
- `takeUntil`

### Multicasting operators

In RxJS observables are cold, or unicast (one source per subscriber) by default. These operators can make an observable hot, or multicast, allowing side-effects to be shared among multiple subscribers. 

The most commonly used creation operators are: 

- `shareReplay`

### Transformation operators

Transforming values as they pass through an operator chain is a common task. These operators provide transformation techniques for nearly any use-case you will encounter.

The most commonly used creation operators are: 

- `concatMap`
- `map`
- `mergeMap`
- `scan`
- `switchMap`

# Subject

A Subject is a special type of Observable which shares a **single execution path among observers**.

You can think of this as a single speaker talking at a microphone in a room full of people. Their message (the subject) is being delivered to many (**multicast**) people (**the observers**) at once.

**This is the basis of multicasting.**

Typical observables would be comparable to a 1 on 1 conversation.

There are 4 variants of subjects:

- **Subject**: No initial values or replay behavior.
- **AsyncSubject** - Emits latest value to observers upon completion
- **BehaviorSubject** - Requires an initial value and emits its current value (last emitted item) to new subscribers.
- **ReplaySubject** - Emits specified numbers of last emitted values (a replay) to new subscribers.

### Example:

```jsx
const subject = new Subject();
const behaviorSubject = new BehaviorSubject(-1);

subject.next(0); // não vai mostrar
behaviorSubject.next(0);

subject.subscribe(value => console.log('Subject: ' + value))
behaviorSubject.subscribe(value => console.log('Behavior: ' + value))

subject.next(1);
behaviorSubject.next(1);

subject.next(2);
behaviorSubject.next(2);

// Output:
// Behavior: 0
// Subject: 1
// Behavior: 1
// Subject: 2
// Behavior: 2
```

# Higher-order Observable

Are a family of operators that end in map.

Observables most commonly emit ordinary values like string and numbers, but surprisingly often, it is necessary to handle **Observable of Observables.** so-called higher-order Observables. 

How its works: Typically, by flattening: by converting a higher-order Observable into an ordinary Observable.

### Example:

```jsx
const fileObservable = urlObservable.pipe(
   concatMap(url => http.get(url)),
);
```

The Observable returned in the `concatMap` function is usually referred to as so-called “inner” Observable, while in this context the `urlObservable` is the so-called “outer” Observable
